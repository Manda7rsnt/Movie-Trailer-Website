# Project 2: Movie Trailer Website

## Project Overview
This project is executed as part of the Udacity's [Python Foundation Nanodegree Program](https://in.udacity.com/course/python-foundation-nanodegree--nd002-inpy)
The project task is to write a server-side code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers

## How the task is achieved
Write a Python program that produces the HTML for a movie website and displays a number of movies. Click on a movie poster to play its trailer

## Project Contents
the project has the following contents:
  - `entertainment_center.py` - main Python script to run
  - `media.py` - contains the class Movie that stores movie details
  - `fresh_tomatoes.py` - creates a HTML file for the website (Udacity supplied)

## Running a project

Download the project zip file to your computer and unzip the file. Or clone this repository to your desktop.
Open the text-based interface for your operating system (e.g. the terminal window in Linux, the command prompt in Windows).
Navigate to the project directory and type in the following command:
```sh
python entertainment_center.py
```
This project is created with Python 3.x and tested. The project should run typically with Python v2.x as well without errors but not tested at the moment.
